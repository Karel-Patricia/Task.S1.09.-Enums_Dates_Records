# Task S1.09 - Enums, Dates and Records

## 📌 Level 1

This module focuses on Java Enums, one of the core language features used to represent finite and controlled sets of values.

In this level, we work with:
* Enum creation
* Using enums in conditions and classes
* Adding behavior and state to enums
* Converting strings to enums safely

All examples are written in Java 8+ and follow clean, readable design principles.

### Exercise 1

Create an enum called Day with the days of the week. Write a function that receives a Day and prints whether it is a weekday or weekend.

### Exercise 2

Create an enum Level with values LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH.
Create a class Task with a Level property and show how the behavior changes depending on the level.

### Exercise 3

Add methods inside the enum and verify that enums can contain logic
(example: a getColor() method for each Level value).

### Exercise 4

Convert a String to an enum using valueOf and handle errors when the value is not valid.
